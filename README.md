## Hi there 👋

My name is Brandon, and I'm taking this class to wrap up my associates and work towards a Bachelor's in Computer Science. I'm interested in computers, tech, coding, video games, camping, hiking, dirt bikes, and competition shooting. I have some very minor experience with coding, but no formal education. I'm looking forward to getting a solid foundation from this class on coding fundamentals and workflow. <!--
